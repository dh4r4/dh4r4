- 👋 Hi, I’m @dh4r4
- 👀 I’m interested in Error codes
- 🌱 I’m currently learning building rooftop bars in Sims 4. (And some malware development and advanced pentesting techniques)

## `$ whoami`
I like cars and opcodes. However, one of them is not working properly :/

Two truths, one lie about me:
- I can't slap that bass
- My favourite language is C
- My dog is an integer
