- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @dh4r4
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Error codes
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning building rooftop bars.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... (Pls don't I'm anti-social)

I should probably be on r/masterhacker. OSCP certified I try to expand my knowledge about the ever expanding world of cyber security.
I'm currently preparing for OSWE, learning Binary Exploitation, Reverse Engineering and general evasion techniques.
